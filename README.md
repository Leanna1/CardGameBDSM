# Introduction

Hi to anyone who found their way to this file ^_^

This repository is about an autohotkey-script which will make it easier for you to play a wonderful game uploaded by the user "Punishmesenpai" on the website https://www.faproulette.co/3406/bdsm-card-game/ (Care NSFW!).

It will open up random images from a folder and will open up every file only once (I thought this would be a nice addition to the game so you don't have several cards of the same type on your hand)

I also added that once all the images/cards were drawn you a message pops up that you won the game.

# Installing the program

To make the program work you will have to download all the image files used by this game and place them into a folder on your pc.

Inside of this repository you will find two files.

**1.** An .exe file

**2.** An .ahk file

If you trust me and are lazy you could just use the .exe file which is a compiled version of the .ahk file.

If you decide to be lazy and don't want to edit anything in the file you will have to place this folder with the pictures on your desktop and name it "Card Game" (without the "'s).

You shouldn't trust me tho as you don't know me. Thats why you should read the .ahk file first and then compile the file yourself with the with the program Autohotkey which can be found on their website at: https://autohotkey.com/

# How to use the program

**F9** starts the program and asks you how many cards you want to draw -> Fill in the number and press Enter

**F12** is used for drawing cards after the game started (used for card effects which make you draw cards)

**!Don't use F9 for drawing more cards after the game started or it could draw duplicates!**
